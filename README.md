#Rules of the game

![](images/image2.png)

**Extra (new) rules implemented in our “hardcore” edition**

- When a player chooses to buy a property, there is a possibility that something will go wrong (for example a possibility to lose the money or meet a thief on the way). In that occasion the player loses the money of the property’s worth and takes nothing in return. (Unfortunate player). There is a 70% possibility that the player will buy the property and 30%, one of the “unfortunate” results to occur and cause the player to lose the money of the investment.
- There are no hotels. So players can only build houses.

**And the old rules that still apply to this game**

- 2-4 players can play.
- A game is played as a series of rounds. Each player takes a turn till a player wins or everybody except one player quits (1 player only is left).
- The players play on a board of specific squares (40 squares).
- Player moves to a new square by rolling two dice.
- After a player rolls the dice, UI elements like player’s name, square e.t.c. are displayed.
- The pieces are advanced clockwise around the board (equal to the sum of the 2 dice).
- The game board is circle, the “go” square in the beginning or the end of a round (1st square in the down, right corner) follows the 40th square on the board.
- A player can buy a property if the property is not owned and the player can afford to buy the property . If the player agrees to buy it, he/she pays the Bank the amount shown on the property space and receives the deed for that property. 
- A player can build a house when he/she owns every property of the same colour.
- A player can build a hotel when he/she has already purchased 4 houses in that property.
- If the player lands on or passes Go in the course of his or her turn, he or she receives $200 from the Bank. 
- A player pays taxes or another player if the square is owned by another player or it is a taxes square.
- If the player lands on his or her own property, or on property which is owned by another player but currently mortgaged, nothing happens.
- A player draws a card if a player lands on chances square or community chest.
- You may sell houses back to the Bank for half the purchase price or sell property deeds to other players in the game.
- Players may not loan money to other players. Only the Bank can loan money, and only through mortgaging properties
- If the player lands on the Jail space, he or she is "Just Visiting". No penalty applies.
- A player goes to jail where he has to pay fine if he/she draws the card “Go to jail” or rolls “doubles” for 3 times.
- If a player is sent to jail, he/she stays there for some rounds.
